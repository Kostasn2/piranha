**Piranha** is an open-source scripting framework currently under development. It is a reusable framework which allows developers to quickly write scripting interfaces to native C++ libraries.

Piranha is currently used as an SDL (scene description language) for the [MantaRay](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/manta-ray) ray-tracer.

To get started, check out the introductory handbook: [Piranha Handbook](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/piranha/blob/master/docs/handbook/handbook.md)

Example Piranha compiler implementation: [Hello World Piranha Compiler](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/piranha-hello-world-compiler)
 
### Setup Instructions For Developers

Only a few steps are required to begin developing on MantaRay:
1. Install Python 3
2. Clone the Piranha repository
3. Open ```project/piranha.sln``` in Microsoft Visual Studio
4. Right click on **piranha_reference_compiler** and select 'Set as StartUp Project'
5. Run the application

You should then see a console window open and a sample Piranha program run.

#### You are now ready to begin development!
