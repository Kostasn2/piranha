**Piranha** is an open-source scripting framework currently under development. It is a reusable framework which allows developers to quickly write scripting interfaces to native C++ libraries.
 
### Setup Instructions For Developers

Only a few steps are required to begin developing on MantaRay:
1. Install Python 3
2. Clone the Piranha repository
3. Open ```project/piranha.sln``` in Microsoft Visual Studio
4. Right click on **piranha_reference_compiler** and select 'Set as StartUp Project'
5. Run the application

You should then see a console window open and a sample Piranha program run.

#### You are now ready to begin development!
